# Simple Blogging Platform API
This is a RESTful API for a simple blogging platform built using Go. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on blog posts.

Remember to replace "username:password@tcp(localhost:3306)/dbname" with your actual database connection details. Also, make sure to handle errors properly and add appropriate error messages in the responses.
